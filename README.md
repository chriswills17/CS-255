Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? :
The clients, DriverPass, offer learning materials and instructor led learning sessions for customers that wish to ensure they pass their driving test. They desired an online accessible system that allowed students to view learning materials and schedule times for an instructor to pick them up for real life driving instruction.

What did you do particularly well? :
I think I had a pretty decent grasp on creating the various UML diagrams, and I was able to understanding their differing uses. I also think I was able to present these well in non-technical terms without the use of jargon.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? :
Concerning the Gannt chart, now that I understand that it takes me more time than other diagrams to produce I would have set aside more time in creating it. I would have created teams specific to each task and use the color coding to denote the teams assigned to their respective tasks.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? :
Without considering user needs in the system, the system has a much higher chance of not obtaining adoption. Whether the user is a student, admin, instructor, etc., having a system that doesn't tend to the basic needs required provides a poor user experience and dissastifaction on the entire system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? :
Listening carefully to the client is imperative, as the system is being built for them. It's important to take as much time as possible when determining requirements for the system. It's also important to view the system from a user viewpoint as well, so that a well-designed and intuitive system is ultimately created.
